A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Machine learning is a subfield of AI that studies the ability to improve performance based on experience.Some AI systems use machine learning methods to achieve competence, but some do not.

-   A checkers learning problem:
    -   Task T: playing checkers
    -   Performance measure P: percent of games won against opponents
    -   Training experience E: playing practice games against itself
