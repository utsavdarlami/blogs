I have made a base site using hugo static generator.
The post are written using org-mode from emacs. The plugin \`[ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/)\` converts the org file to markdown and places it to the posts folder of the hugo site folder.
I have also used roam capture template so that the placeholder for tags and categories are perdefined in new org files.
The placeholder includes roam\_tags, hugo\_tags, hugo\_categories, HUGO\_BASE\_DIR path


## Things i need to fix {#things-i-need-to-fix}

-   There is problem in site rendering when a org file is linked to a org file which has not been exported to markdown. I might not export all my notes to markdown because they might be publishable.

-   Add biblography
