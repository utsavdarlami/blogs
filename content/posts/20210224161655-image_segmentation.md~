## Using Deep Learning {#using-deep-learning}


### UNET {#unet}

## Image Segmentation Loss/ Evaluation Method {#image-segmentation-loss-evaluation-method}

-   Problem with other common metrics
-   We need metrics that target pixels in foreground


### Intersection over union {#intersection-over-union}

-   Overall accuracy is not a good metric for semantic segmentation, especially for imbalanced dataset
-   IOU = \\(\frac{Intersection}{Union}\\)

    = \\(\frac{\sum{\hat{y}\*y}} {\sum{\hat{y} + y - \hat{y} \* y}}\\)


### [Dice Score]({{< relref "20210224162319-ml_evaluations_score" >}}) {#dice-score--20210224162319-ml-evaluations-score-dot-md}

-   Easy to differentiate
-   For Image = \\(\frac{2\*\sum{\hat{y}\*y}} {\sum{\hat{y} + y}}\\)
-   priortise both precision and recall equally
-   Loss = 1 - Dice


## Carvana Log {#carvana-log}

-   Fixed the bit mask and operation while passing the tensor
-   The dice score on whole training dataset was calculated, 0.67 was score obtained
